# Beach Bugs
Get to the water without touching a bug! A practice game.

## How to:

##### Run the game
https://jgigrich.github.io/Beach-Bugs/
And if you fork and clone the repo to a local repository just run the index.html file

##### Play the game
Control your player with the arrow keys or the wasd keys.

You just want to run arcross the road and jump into the water, but not only are there bugs everywhere they forgot to turn off the red electric fence!

The key you need to turn off the fence is yellow and often floats near the fence. Grab this key and bring it back to the fence control to turn off the fence. Then make a run for water, making sure to avoid the bugs.

Any bug contact and you start over. Have fun!
